### Reasonable solutions

```elixir
defmodule Bob do
  def hey(input) do
    cond do
      shouting_question?(input) -> "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"
      question?(input) -> "Sure."
      shouting?(input) -> "Whoa, chill out!"
      silence?(input) -> "Fine. Be that way!"
      true -> "Whatever."
    end
  end

  defp shouting_question?(input) do
    question?(input) && shouting?(input)
  end

  defp question?(input) do
    String.ends_with?(input, "?")
  end

  defp shouting?(input) do
    String.upcase(input) == input && String.downcase(input) != input
  end

  defp silence?(input) do
    String.trim(input) == ""
  end
end
```

### Common suggestions

#### Hardcoding test data

As first real exercise on the track, students will frequently hardcode test data to get to a solution.
They should be recommended to find a more general solution. 

#### `is_shouting`

If a solution uses names like `is_shouting` and `is_question`,
it can be pointed out that Elixir has the following naming convention:
- `is_foo` should only be used for macros that can be used in guard clauses,
- `foo?` should be used otherwise.

#### Usage of regular expressions

This exercise can be solved without regular expressions and a student could be encouraged to try to do that.
 - Regular expressions are not known for their readability. `String.ends_with?(input, "?")` is more obvious than `Regex.match?(~r/\?$/, input)`.
 - It is a good habit to use simple tools for simple problems and advanced tools for advanced problems.
 - Elixir developers should be familiar with the `String` module and the functions it offers.

#### Hint functions for the truely stuck

- [`String#trim/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#trim/1)
- [`String#ends_with?/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#ends_with?/2)
- [`String#downcase/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#downcase/2)
- [`String#upcase/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#upcase/2)
- `String.upcase(input) != String.downcase(input)` if there is a letter present.

#### Style guide

This is the first time on the track that students get to define their own functions and frequently trip over naming conventions.
